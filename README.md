This tool helps you to keep track of the jobs that you have applied
by storing the job description webpage as an HTML file as well as copying your
template files such as your resume and your cover letter to the same place.

Please do not forget to update the CONFIG section with the correct paths on the top of the script.

I hope it helps you to find what you deserve :)
